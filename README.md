# Smart Text Classification Pipeline with Transformers

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook walks you through a clean, modular pipeline to load, explore, and preprocess text data for classification using state-of-the-art transformer models. Leveraging the power of Hugging Face and PyTorch, it prepares any NLP dataset for training with minimal configuration required.

## Features

- Seamlessly load datasets from the Hugging Face Hub
- Convert and inspect datasets in pandas format
- Tokenize text using a pretrained `AutoTokenizer`
- Structure your dataset for downstream training tasks

## Requirements

To run this notebook, make sure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch matplotlib numpy
```

## Libraries Used

- `transformers` – Hugging Face model and tokenizer APIs
- `datasets` – Easy access to NLP datasets from the Hugging Face Hub
- `torch` – PyTorch for tensor manipulation and model training
- `numpy`, `matplotlib` – For analysis and visualization

## Notebook Structure

### 1. Load and Inspect Dataset

- Load a text dataset using `datasets.load_dataset`
- Convert it to a pandas DataFrame for inspection
- View sample entries and understand the distribution

### 2. Tokenize Dataset

- Load a pretrained tokenizer (e.g., DistilBERT)
- Efficiently tokenize the entire dataset
- Prepare it for batching and training

## How to Use

1. **Install dependencies** (see Requirements above)
2. **Launch the notebook** in Jupyter or any compatible environment
3. **Step through each cell** in order:
   - Load your dataset
   - Inspect and understand your text
   - Apply tokenization
4. **Customize** the dataset or tokenizer model name as needed
5. Export, train, or integrate into your pipeline

## Notes

- The notebook is designed for classification tasks. For sequence-to-sequence or QA tasks, you may need to adjust the tokenizer and model configurations.
- You can easily extend this notebook by adding training logic using PyTorch or Hugging Face’s `Trainer` API.
